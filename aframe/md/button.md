# @micosmo/aframe/button

Aframe component that implements a virtual button controller that can be triggered by collision detection events, virtual trigger events or keyboard events.
The entity element that the *button* component is attached to is assumed to be a visual representation of a button. The *button* component is configured with a button *press* color that will be applied to the visual element when the button is fires and the pressed state is entered. The color is restored when the button *release* occurs.

## API

### IMPORTING

```javascript
import '@micosmo/aframe/button';
```

### COMPONENTS

#### button

Implements a virtual button controller that generates synthetic *vrbuttondown* and *vrbuttonup* events to the element that the button is connected to.

The *button* component listens to the following events:
* collisionstart : Collision detection event that is generated by a [collider]('./collider') that is also attached to the element.
* collisionend : Collision ended event that is generated by a [collider]('./collider') that is also attached to the element.
* Other events as defined by the schema.

##### SCHEMA

Property | Type | Default | Description
-------- | ---- | ------- | -----------
pressedColor | color | red | The color that is applied to the element that the button component is attached to.
playCooldown | number | 0.5 | The time in seconds that the button cools down before responding to new input events.
keyid | string | '' | The logical key name that is assigned to this *button*. If this is not specified then generic key event listeners are added that will map to all keys in the associated *keymap*. Works fine if the *keymap* is dedicated to the *button*.
events | array[string] | ['triggerDown', 'triggerUp'] | Synthetic events that the *button* will listen for. The first event id will map to the button's *press* behaviour and the second to the button's *release* behaviour. If only one of the events is provided the *button* will simulate a *press* and *release* sequence.
